# Member Management
A compilation of scripts used to automate member management of the `uhasselt-students` organization.

### signup
These scripts are bound to a Google Form in which new members enter their account details. The scripts automate the process of adding the new members to all the different services that we use (GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, Firebase, etc.). Each time the form is submitted, `onFormSubmit` is called in `Code.gs`.
